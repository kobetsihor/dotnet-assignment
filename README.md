# Senior Backend Assignment â€“ Calendar API

As part of the interview process, weâ€™d like to evaluate your technical and architectural skills through a short assignment. The goal is to assess your ability to design and implement a clean, maintainable, and scalable API.

## Assignment Overview

Youâ€™ve just joined our backend team, which is currently developing an appointment system for a veterinary clinic. The system allows clinic staff to manage pet owners, and their appointments, but now we would like to implement new features.


## âœ… Task 1: List Vet Appointments

Implement an endpoint to retrieve all appointments assigned to a specific veterinarian within a given date range.

Input:
  - Vet ID
  - Start date
  - End date

Output:
  -  List of appointments including time, animal name, owner name, and status



## âœ… Task 2: Update Appointment Status

Allow a veterinarian to update the status of an appointment.

Rules:
  -  Valid status values: Scheduled, Completed, Canceled
  -  An appointment cannot be canceled within 1 hour of its scheduled start time
  -  When an appointment is canceled, send a mock email notification to the pet owner (e.g., Console.WriteLine("Email sent to owner@example.com"))


## âœ… Task 3: Use EF Core with a Local Database

Use Entity Framework Core with either:
  -  An In-Memory provider (for simplicity)
  -  Or SQLite (if youâ€™d like to demonstrate something closer to production)


## âœ… Task 4: Find Error and Fix It
Review the provided code and identify any bugs or issues if exits.


## ðŸ“¦ Delivery Instructions
  -  Submit your solution as a GitHub repository or a ZIP file
  -  If you had more time, include a short note explaining:
     -  What you would have improved
     -  How youâ€™d scale or evolve the solution


If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to ask. Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing your solution!

Further Improvements & Evolution
If more time were available, I would focus on:
â€¢	Comprehensive Integration & Unit Testing:
    Expand test coverage to include edge cases, error scenarios, and integration tests for all endpoints and domain logic.
â€¢	Advanced Error Handling & Logging:
    Implement structured logging (e.g., Serilog) and enhance exception handling for better diagnostics and maintainability.
â€¢	API Versioning & Documentation:
    Add API versioning and improve Swagger documentation, including response examples and security schemes.
â€¢	Security & Authentication:
    Integrate authentication/authorization (e.g., JWT Bearer) to secure endpoints and support role-based access.
â€¢	Performance & Scalability:
    Optimize database queries, introduce caching (e.g., Redis), and prepare for horizontal scaling using container orchestration (Kubernetes).
â€¢	CI/CD Pipeline:
    Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for reliable delivery.

Scaling & Evolution
To scale or evolve the solution:
â€¢	Microservices Architecture:
  Decompose the monolithic API into smaller, focused services (e.g., Appointments, Animals, Notifications) for independent scaling and deployment.
â€¢	Event-Driven Communication:
  Use messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) for decoupled workflows and asynchronous processing (e.g., notifications).
â€¢	Cloud Readiness:
  Containerize all services and leverage cloud-native features (e.g., Azure App Service, AWS ECS) for resilience and scalability.
â€¢	Multi-Tenancy & Localization:
  Add support for multiple clinics/veterinarians and localize the API for broader adoption.

Architecture & Design
Layered Structure
This solution is organized into clear layers for maintainability and scalability:
  â€¢	API Layer:
Contains controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses. Controllers are kept thin and delegate all business logic to the domain layer via MediatR.
  â€¢	Domain Layer:
Encapsulates business logic, domain models, and MediatR handlers. All business rules and orchestration are implemented here, ensuring separation from presentation and data access concerns.
  â€¢	Data Access Layer:
Contains repositories and entity models for database operations. This layer is responsible for persistence and retrieval, abstracting the underlying data store.
MediatR Integration
The project uses MediatR to implement the mediator pattern:
  â€¢	Decoupling:
Controllers do not directly interact with services or repositories. Instead, they send commands and queries to MediatR, which dispatches them to the appropriate handler in the domain layer.
  â€¢	Centralized Request Handling:
All business operations (such as creating, updating, or retrieving appointments and animals) are processed through MediatR requests and handlers.
  â€¢	Pipeline Behaviors:
Cross-cutting concerns (like validation, logging, or transactions) can be handled via MediatR pipeline behaviors, further decoupling these aspects from business logic.
Benefits
  â€¢	Separation of Concerns:
Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
  â€¢	Testability:
Business logic is isolated in handlers, enabling straightforward unit testing without involving the API or data access layers.
  â€¢	Scalability & Flexibility:
The architecture supports future growth, such as adding new features, refactoring, or migrating to microservices.

Additional Features
  â€¢	FluentValidation:
Integrated for automatic request validation, keeping controllers clean and enforcing business rules at the boundary.
  â€¢	Global Exception Handling:
Middleware provides consistent error responses and simplifies error management.
  â€¢	AutoMapper Profiles:
Centralized mapping logic for request/response and domain/entity conversions.
  â€¢	Docker Support:
Dockerfile included for easy containerization and deployment.
